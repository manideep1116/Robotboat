# Robotboat
 Robotboat employs JAVA to generate and control a simulative boat (consisting location, speed, compass, fuel, battery, rudder, propellers etc.) to find out lattitudes and longitudes between user specified co-ordinates in a given region(Map).It has a GUI, where we can simulate the boat automatically or manually.
